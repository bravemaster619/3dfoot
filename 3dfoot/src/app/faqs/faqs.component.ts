      question: "How does it work?",
      answer: "You simply need to take three photographs of each foot using our easy to use, guided app and using AI techniques and thatâ€™s enough to build a highly accurate 3d model of each foot. Once this is done you just have to place your order and we do the rest.",

      question: "How accurate is it?",
