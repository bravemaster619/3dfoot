            <h4>How does it work?</h4>
            <p>
                You simply need to take three photographs of each foot using our easy to use, guided app and using AI techniques and thatâ€™s enough to build a highly accurate 3d model of each foot. Once this is done you just have to place your order and we do the rest.

            <h4>How accurate is it?</h4>
            <p>
                We compare your scans with our database of over 500,000 feet, this combined with complex mathematical algorithms means we can very accurately produce custom profiles of your feet from 3 images of each foot.

                Do I have to scan my feet every time I want to place an order?
                No, you do this only once and then your 3d feet profile is saved against your account meaning you can re order at any time simply by placing an order.
